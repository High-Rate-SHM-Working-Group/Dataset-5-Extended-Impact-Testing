# [Dataset 2](./data-1)

Dataset 2 consists of 32 tests performed May 5 2023. Tests were performed consecutively on the same PCB. Following each impact test, impedance was measured at five LCR excitation frequencies. The folder also contains a python file with a demonstration for extracting data from the .lvm files and plotting, and figures plotting the acceleration and measured impedance.
